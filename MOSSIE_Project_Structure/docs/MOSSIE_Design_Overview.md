## Purpose

This document outlines the conceptual design of the MOSSIE system (Martian Oasis Sub-Surface Initiative for Ecosystems), aimed at establishing passive, long-term water flow and microbial life-support infrastructure on Mars.

## 1. System Overview

MOSSIE utilizes a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) to heat subsurface CO₂ and H₂O-rich layers of the Martian regolith. The thermal reaction results in the gradual release of vaporized water and carbon dioxide, which are then either vented, condensed, or collected depending on configuration.

The process is designed to be:

* Passive (no electrical components or active control required)
* Long-duration (operational lifespan of 10–20 years)
* Low-maintenance (buried and sealed deployment)
* Modular (scalable across sites)

## 2. Key Components

| Component                      | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RTG Core**                   | Provides sustained thermal energy from plutonium-238 decay. Inserted directly into subsurface reaction pit.                         |
| **Reaction Pit**               | Drilled shaft or excavation into ice/CO₂-rich layer. Serves as the thermal interface.                                               |
| **Mini-Hill Structure**        | Shallow earth mound placed around vent to direct outgassing upward.                                                                 |
| **Mini-Dome Condenser**        | Transparent or semi-enclosed dome to trap heat and slow gas diffusion. Optionally contains condensation mesh or chemical absorbers. |
| **Gas Flow Channels**          | Optional underground pipes or porous paths to redirect gas/water vapor flows.                                                       |
| **Capture Systems (Optional)** | CO₂ condensers, pressurized tanks, or Sabatier reactors. Only needed if capture is intended.                                        |

## 3. Subsurface Water Flow Generation

* Heat from the RTG induces gradual melting of subsurface ice.
* If pressure and terrain permit, water flows horizontally along a pre-modeled gradient.
* Channels may become semi-permanent streams, collecting in micro-basins.
* Internal water flow can also assist in thermal distribution across adjacent reaction pits.

## 4. Biological Seeding (See MOSSIE\_BioProtocol.md)

* Once flow is established, extremophile microorganisms can be introduced.
* Biotic feedback (oxygenation, biofilm, nutrient cycling) enhances internal equilibrium.
* System becomes a closed-loop micro-ecosystem if properly balanced.

## 5. Structural Layout (Simplified)

```
[RTG] → [Reaction Pit] → [Mini-Hill] → [Dome Enclosure]
                         ↓
                   [Water Channeling Layer]
                         ↓
                 [Underground Stream Path]
```

## 6. Deployment Strategy

* Pre-scanning of target location (ice/CO₂ maps)
* Robotic or semi-autonomous drilling rig creates pit
* RTG lowered and sealed in place
* Mini-structure assembled on surface
* Long-term monitoring or periodic flyby-based thermal imagery suggested

## 7. Open Questions & Future Simulation Needs

* Exact depth and configuration for optimal thermal spread
* CO₂ vs. H₂O reaction timelines and flow ratios
* Microbial survivability with minimal human maintenance
* Integration with broader ISRU systems or habitats

## Status

Conceptual Phase Only — Physical modeling, computational fluid simulation, and biological payload planning remain as future steps.
