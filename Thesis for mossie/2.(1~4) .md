2.1 Current Status of RTG-Based Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) are power systems that convert heat released from the radioactive decay of isotopes, typically Plutonium-238 (Pu-238), into electricity. Due to their mechanical simplicity and long-term reliability, RTGs have been widely utilized in deep-space missions where solar power is insufficient or unavailable.

Historically, RTGs have been deployed in several high-profile missions:

MMRTG (Multi-Mission RTG): Used in the Curiosity rover on Mars, it provides approximately 110 watts of electrical power and has an expected operational lifespan of over 14 years.

GPHS-RTG (General Purpose Heat Source RTG): Employed in Voyager 1 and 2, these units operated for over 30 years, providing up to 300 watts during peak operation.

Ongoing development efforts in agencies such as ESA (European Space Agency) indicate continued international interest in RTG technology for future missions.

From a technical perspective, RTGs are characterized by:

Decay heat output: Providing both electricity and continuous thermal energy, which is critical for system heating in harsh planetary environments.

Power degradation rate: Approximately 1% per year, enabling consistent long-term output.

No moving parts: Enhancing system robustness and minimizing maintenance needs.

In the context of the MOSSIE project, RTGs serve not as power sources for instrumentation, but as core thermal initiators for subsurface reactions. By embedding RTGs into CO₂- and H₂O-rich Martian sublayers, sustained heat fluxes can induce melting and gas release, forming the foundation for passive biological infrastructure.

Given their extensive track record and self-contained operation, RTGs represent an ideal energy foundation for autonomous, long-duration subsurface systems like MOSSIE.

2.2 Subsurface Distribution of Water Ice and Carbon Dioxide on Mars
Overview
Understanding the distribution of subsurface water ice and carbon dioxide (CO₂) on Mars is crucial for the development of autonomous ecological systems like MOSSIE. Remote sensing instruments, particularly radar sounders such as SHARAD (Shallow Radar) on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) on ESA's Mars Express, have provided significant insights into the presence and extent of these resources.

Subsurface Water Ice
Polar Regions: Extensive deposits of water ice have been detected beneath the Martian polar caps. SHARAD data reveal that the north polar layered deposits contain vast amounts of nearly pure water ice, extending to depths of several kilometers .

Mid-Latitudes: Evidence from SHARAD and MARSIS indicates the presence of buried glaciers and ice-rich lobate debris aprons in the mid-latitudes, suggesting that substantial water ice exists beneath insulating layers of regolith .

Equatorial Regions: While less abundant, some studies suggest that subsurface ice may exist even at lower latitudes, particularly on pole-facing slopes where conditions allow for ice stability .

Subsurface Carbon Dioxide
South Polar Cap: MARSIS observations have identified massive deposits of CO₂ ice beneath the south polar layered deposits. These CO₂-rich layers are estimated to contain enough gas to double the current Martian atmospheric pressure if released .

Atmospheric Implications: The sequestration and potential release of CO₂ from these subsurface deposits have significant implications for Martian climate dynamics and the feasibility of terraforming efforts.

Implications for MOSSIE
The confirmed presence of subsurface water ice and CO₂ provides a viable foundation for the MOSSIE system. By leveraging the thermal output of RTGs, MOSSIE aims to induce localized melting of ice and sublimation of CO₂, creating a controlled environment conducive to the establishment of a self-sustaining ecosystem.

2.2 Subsurface Distribution of Water Ice and Carbon Dioxide on Mars
2.2.1 Subsurface Water Ice
Extensive radar sounding data from instruments such as SHARAD (onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) have confirmed the presence of significant subsurface water ice deposits across various Martian regions, particularly in the mid-latitudes.

Arcadia Planitia:
Bramson et al. (2015) identified widespread excess ice in Arcadia Planitia, with SHARAD data indicating subsurface ice layers tens of meters thick and covering thousands of square kilometers. The estimated total volume of ice in this region is approximately 10,000 km³, suggesting long-term preservation beneath an insulating regolith layer.
[Bramson et al., GRL, 2015]

Utopia Planitia:
Stuurman et al. (2016) reported a massive subsurface water ice deposit beneath Utopia Planitia, interpreted as relic ice preserved under a thin regolith cover. The volume is estimated to rival that of Earth’s Lake Superior.
[Stuurman et al., GRL, 2016]

Hellas Planitia:
Holt et al. (2008) used SHARAD radar to detect buried glaciers in Hellas Planitia, revealing ice structures with thicknesses up to 450 meters. These formations are consistent with debris-covered glaciers, supporting hypotheses of large-scale ice preservation in mid-latitudes.
[Holt et al., Science, 2008]

2.2.2 Subsurface Carbon Dioxide Ice
The south polar region of Mars hosts a large volume of buried carbon dioxide (CO₂) ice, identified primarily through MARSIS radar soundings.

South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD):
Phillips et al. (2011) estimated that approximately 9,500–12,500 km³ of CO₂ ice is trapped beneath the SPLD. If released, this amount could double the current Martian atmospheric pressure, indicating both climatological significance and potential utility for in-situ engineering.
[Phillips et al., Science, 2011]

CO₂ Ice Glaciers:
Smith et al. (2022) found that CO₂ ice behaves as a flowing glacial mass under Martian conditions, with potential flow rates up to 100 times faster than water ice. This dynamic behavior impacts both stability and thermal response modeling in future Martian infrastructure.
[Smith et al., JGR Planets, 2022]

2.2.3 Implications for the MOSSIE System
The confirmed abundance of both water ice and CO₂ ice beneath the Martian surface provides critical support for the feasibility of the MOSSIE initiative. These resources can be activated via localized thermal input from RTGs, initiating controlled melting and sublimation processes. Regions such as Arcadia Planitia and Utopia Planitia—due to their relatively shallow ice depth and stable conditions—are considered prime candidates for MOSSIE deployment and pilot-scale autonomous ecological nodes.

### 2.4.2 Assessing the Necessity of Microbial Introduction in Terraforming

| Objective            | Microbial Involvement | Rationale                                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Oxygen production    | Required              | Essential for pre-biospheric atmosphere development via photosynthesis    |
| Soil conditioning    | Required              | Microbial organic matter is necessary for plant-rooted systems            |
| Climate modulation   | Optional              | Methane generation offers localized warming but is limited in scale/speed |
| Technical viability  | Conditional           | Risk of biosphere disruption and planetary contamination must be addressed |


2.4.3 Strategic Application within MOSSIE
Subsurface-Adapted Organism Selection
MOSSIE environments are likely low-light, anoxic, and isolated; thus, facultative anaerobes or chemolithoautotrophs should be prioritized. Methanogens, due to their low-energy requirements and tolerance to Martian pressures, are strong candidates.

Closed-Loop Biotic Feedback Systems
Selected organisms should not only survive but contribute to a sustainable ecosystem cycle—engaging in CO₂ fixation, oxygen release (where applicable), and nutrient recycling to promote micro-ecological stability.

Planetary Protection Compliance
MOSSIE must conform to planetary protection protocols (e.g., COSPAR Category IV). Deployment of extremophiles may necessitate containment strategies or isolated testbeds to prevent irreversible contamination of potential native biospheres.
